          Milk chocolate is a solid chocolate confectionery containing cocoa,
          sugar and milk. It is the most consumed type of chocolate. Chocolate
          was originally sold and consumed as a beverage in pre-Columbian times.
          Although four-fifths of all milk chocolate is sold in the United
          States and Europe, increasingly large amounts are consumed in China
          and Latin America.

          Milk is a white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals.
          It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals (including
          breastfed human infants) before they are able to digest solid
          food.Early-lactation milk, which is called colostrum, contains
          antibodies that strengthen the immune system, and thus reduces the
          risk of many diseases. Milk contains many nutrients, including protein
          and lactose.

          They’re a good source of fiber, healthy fats, and plant protein. Plus,
          they’re great on their own, paired with fruit, or added to dishes like

          Semi-sweet chocolate has a cocoa solid content of 35 to 65%. One of
          the best ways to gain an understanding of this type of chocolate is to
          compare it to a different type of chocolate. Semisweet is darker than
          milk chocolate. In a taste comparison, it has a slightly bitter taste
          whereas milk chocolate is sweeter and more mellow. This delectable
          flavor of chocolate is very versatile.
